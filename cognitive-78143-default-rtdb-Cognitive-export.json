    "Description": "The dopaminergic neurons are in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (VTA). L-phenylalanine is converted into L-tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. L-tyrosine is then converted into L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. L-DOPA is then converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Dopamine is removed from the synaptic cleft by the dopamine transporter (DAT). Dopamine is degraded by monoamine oxidase A and B, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), in succession. The dopamine receptors are categorized into a D1-like family (including D1 and D5) and a D2-like family (including D2, D3, and D4). The D2 receptors are the best studied.",

The alleles are the minor allele A (called ‘met’ type, for methionine) and the major allele G (called ‘val’ for valine). The met type has also been called ‘the worrier,’ while the val type has been called ‘the warrior.’ Homozygotes for A (‘worriers’) experience about a 40% reduced enzyme activity, leading to greater neurotransmitter presence in the brain. They have better working memories, exhibit better reading comprehension, they may have higher IQs, and they get more pleasure from experiences. These titles are a bit misleading, as there are advantages to both homozygote phenotypes. It appears that A homozygotes may be better at long-term goal accomplishment, essentially, due to greater neuroticism.",

    "Description": "The neurotransmitter serotonin is produced from the amino acid L-tryptophan. Using the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), it is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), which is then converted to 5-HT (serotonin) by amino acid decarboxylase. Serotonin is originally located in the raphe nuclei in the brain stem from where it is communicated across the brain through its axons. It is broken down by the serotonin transporter (SERT) and by the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT). PMAT is newly discovered. It is encoded by the gene SLC29A4, but not much is known about its variants. SERT is the target of the SSRI drugs, which inhibit its function, thereby allowing serotonin to remain in the synaptic cleft. Most of the studies on the genetics of serotonin regard the functions of the SERT protein, which was being studied as early as the 1990’s.",
